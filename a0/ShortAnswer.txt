1. Assume I plan to use the friend_overlap function above to quantify the
similarity of two users. E.g., because 14 is larger than 1, I conclude that
Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warrent are more similar than Bernie Sanders and Donald
Trump.
How is this approach misleading? How might you fix it?

Answer:
The smaller number of overlap friends does not mean the weaker similarity. 
We need to consider the ratio of overlap number and total number.  
14/(1390+493)= 0.0074
1/(1390+47)=0.0007
This result still shows that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warrent are more similar than Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.

For further research in similarities, we might categorize their followings, apply weights on different categories.



2. Looking at the output of your followed_by_bernie_and_donald function, why
do you think this user is followed by both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump,
who are rivals? Do some web searches to see if you can find out more
information.

Answer:
The output is "VP", Vice President Mike Pence. 
Although Bernie and Trump are rivals in elections, Bernie said he would keep an open mind to see what ideas 
Mr.Trump offers and when and how they can work together. 
(Reference:https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/opinion/bernie-sanders-where-the-democrats-go-from-here.html?&_r=0). 
From this article, I see Bernie is calm and pragmatic and keeps object rationality. 
I am not surprised he follows Mike Pence who is meek, tough, and intelligent as a vice president, even an excellent candidate for president.     



3. There is a big difference in how many accounts each candidate follows (Bernie Sanders follows over 1.3K accounts, while Donald Trump follows less than
50). Why do you think this is? How might that affect our analysis?

Answer:
This depends on the personality and reputation. Bernie might need more connections with other people 
who might support him. While for Trump, the less is more. I see most celebrities on social network 
have huge amounts of followers but less following others. This is a good way to show that they have high profile.  



4. The follower graph we've collected is incomplete. To expand it, we would
have to also collect the list of accounts followed by each of the
friends. That is, for each user X that Donald Trump follows, we would have to
also collect all the users that X follows. Assuming we again use the API call
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids, how many requests will
we have to make? Given how Twitter does rate limiting
(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting), approximately how many
minutes will it take to collect this data?

Answer:
Base on the output, Trump follows 47 users. For each user, we need to get friends and ids. 
Based on the API reference, 15 requests/15mins. Then we need 47 requests, 47/15= 3.13, 
which will take about 4 window sessions 60mins in total.

For all candidates, the total (1390+22+493+47)-(14+3+3+2+1+1)=1928, 1928/15=128.5, 
which will takes about 129 window sessions 1935mins in total.
